# French Real Estate Market Data Management Project

## Description
This project is an extensive data management initiative focused on the French real estate market, covering all transactions from 2017 to 2022. With over 8 million records, the project required meticulous attention to data quality. Our objective was to collect, clean, and analyze this massive dataset to extract meaningful insights. After an extensive data cleansing process, we refined the dataset to include only the most relevant information. We performed variable type validations, added necessary columns, and conducted statistical analyses. The project culminates in a comprehensive visualization tool that showcases trends in the French real estate market over the past five years, including price trends and land value assessments for apartments and other dwellings, with regional and departmental breakdowns.
